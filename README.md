# VisualPatrolBot
## About:
The TurboPI is a very nice metallic robot car kit for a Raspberry Pi (4b) with a bunch of sensors (4 motors, 4 mecanum wheels, camera mounted with two servos, line follower, ultrasonic sensor with multicolor LED lights).
It comes with a set of software that allows fairly easily get started with getting the robot to do things.

My project is to program the robot to so it can navigate around a room and until it will finds the target (Red Ball). 
--- The project is a work in progress ---
