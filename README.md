# VisualPatrolBot
## About:
The TurboPi is ametallic robot car kit designed for the Raspberry Pi 4B. It features four motors, four mecanum wheels, a camera mounted on two servos, a line follower, and an ultrasonic sensor with multicolor LED lights.



My project aims to program the TurboPi to autonomously navigate a room until it locates a specific target—a red ball.

— This project is a work in progress —
