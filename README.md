## About:
The TurboPi is ametallic robot car kit designed for the Raspberry Pi 4B. It features four motors, four mecanum wheels, a camera mounted on two servos, a line follower, and an ultrasonic sensor with multicolor LED lights.

My project aims to program the TurboPi to autonomously navigate a room until it locates a specific target—a red ball.

— This project is a work in progress —

The device will scan the environment and stop once it detects the specified color code.

Future Implementation:

Enhance the robot’s navigation by using a depth map to determine orientation. See the Jupyter Notebook here: DepthMap_of_a_Ball.ipynb
